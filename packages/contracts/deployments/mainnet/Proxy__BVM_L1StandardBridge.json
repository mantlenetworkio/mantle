    "details": "Basic ChugSplash proxy contract for L1. Very close to being a normal proxy but has added functions `setCode` and `setStorage` for changing the code or storage of the contract. Nifty! Note for future developers: do NOT make anything in this contract 'public' unless you know what you're doing. Anything public can potentially have a function signature that conflicts with a signature attached to the implementation contract. Public functions SHOULD always have the 'proxyCallIfNotOwner' modifier unless there's some *really* good reason not to have that modifier. And there almost certainly is not a good reason to not have that modifier. Beware!",
